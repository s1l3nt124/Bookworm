            <h2>Full Story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears</h2>
            <p id="story-goldilocks">Goldilocks was a curious little girl who went for a walk in the forest. She found a house where three bears lived. When no one was home, she went inside. First, she tried their porridge. One was too hot, one was too cold, and one was just right, so she ate it all up. Then, she sat in their chairs. One was too big, one was too small, and one was just right, but she broke it. Finally, she tried their beds. One was too hard, one was too soft, and one was just right, so she fell asleep. When the bears came back, they were surprised to find Goldilocks, and she quickly ran away, learning a lesson to be more careful.</p>
